      <h1>Thanks for taking the time to check out my story!</h1>
      <h3>Now where to begin...?</h3>
      <p>
        As I already mentioned, I am currently serving as a
        <span>Police Officer</span> in the Metropolitan Police Service in
        London. I have been doing this for the past <span>ten years</span> and
        have picked up a wealth of
        <span
          >experience in problem-solving, communications and risk
          management.</span
        >
        I am now looking to start the next chapter of my life by transferring
        all of the skills I have learned so far and applying them to a
        <span>career in technology.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been teaching myself the basics of
        <span>Web Development</span> over the past year and have utilised a
        number of free online resources. I started with
        <span>Harvard's CS50</span> but, despite getting an insight into
        Computer Science and the foundations of programming, I found the course
        was beyond my skill level. I switched to the
        <span>Responsive Web Design</span> course provided by
        <span>FreeCodeCamp.org</span> and completed the sections on frontend
        development before overwhelming myself with the sections on backend
        development and databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeking a more visual and interactive teaching style, I switched to
        <span>Udemy</span> and enrolled on the
        <span>100 Days of Coding course by Acamind.</span> I absolutely loved
        this course and felt that it really took my learning journey to the next
        level by getting my focused on
        <span>creating projects, making mistakes and learning on the fly.</span>
        After finishing this course, I started work on my first two projects:
        Trackman and Pints and Playgrounds. These were both
        <span>fullstack projects</span> that were great ways to put eveything I
        had learned on the course into practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I complimented this course with a
        <span>Vue.js course, also by Acadamind,</span> and started messing
        around with little frontend projects which were mostly
        <span> by my daughter.</span> These projects are by no means perfect or
        ground-breaking, but the important thing for me was that
        <span> I got them to work as intended!</span> I know that I will be able
        to tody the code up and polish them off as I gain more practice and
        experience.
      </p>
      <h3>Next Steps...</h3>
      <p>
        I am now working to improve my <span>code readability</span> and file
        structuring in preparation for
        <span>working with others in a professional environment.</span> I am
        also working on a good quality CV and this very website in order to best
        showcase <span>my skills and abilities.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
